## Installation
To install the required packages, you can download the required packages individually using: 
`pip3 install package_name`  
or, alternatively, use the requirements.txt file: 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  

Download the repository as a whole to run the demos. Install time should be less than 10 minutes.

## Demo
### 1: Data Collection
Images can be downloaded from: https://www.angelolab.com/mibi-data.  
Only step 2 requires these images directly--all other parts of analysis can be run without it, as intermediate data is provided.

### 2: Preliminary Features
**Note**: this step requires the original image dataset in order to be run. If the reviewer chooses to download the images, please edit the paths in the code.\
`python3 calculate_cell_prevalence.py`  \
**Purpose**: calculate the proportion of cells of each cell type in each patient's image.\
**Output**: a CSV file in the intermediate_data/ folder indicating the prevalence of each cell type in each patient's image.  \

`python3 calculate_protein_expression.py`  \
**Purpose**: Calculate protein expression in each cell of each patient's image and assign positivity to each cell based on a threshold.\
**Output**: CSVs of expression levels in the intermediate_data/protein_expression/ folder and positivity assignments in intermediate_data/created_protein_positivity/  

### 3: Immune Composition
`python3 immune_composition.py`\
**Purpose**: determine whether immune composition is associated with recurrence or survival.\
**Ouput**: two results CSVs in results/.

### 4: Protein Expression
`python3 protein_expression.py`\
**Purpose**: determine whether the expression of functional proteins is associated with recurrence or survival.\
**Output**: two results CSVs in results/.

### 5: Protein Co-expression
`python3 calculate_coexpression.py`\
**Purpose**: Calculate instances of co-expression between proteins.\
**Output**: intermediate_data/created_coexpression_matrices/. The reader can compare this output to coexpression_matrices/ to ensure reproducibility.\
**Estimated time**: 10 minutes. 

`python3 protein_coexpression.py`\
**Purpose**: determine whether protein co-expression patterns are predictors of recurrence and survival.\
**Output**: two KM curves with log-rank test p-value in results/.

### 6: Cell-to-cell Interactions
`python3 voronoi_interactions.py`\
**Purpose**: calculate cell-to-cell interactions using Voronoi diagrams.\
**Output**: interaction matrices in intermediate_data/created_interaction_matrices. The reader can compare this output to interaction_matrices/ to ensure reproducibility.  \
*Estimated time*: 40 minutes.

`python3 functional_protein_interactions.py`\
**Purpose**: determine whether interactions involving functional proteins are predictors of recurrence and survival.\
**Output**: two KM curves with log-rank test p-value in results/.  

`python3 functional_protein_interactions.py`\
**Purpose**: determine whether interactions involving immunoregulatory proteins are predictors of recurrence and survival.\
**Output**: two KM curves with log-rank test p-value in results/. 

### 7: Multivariate Analysis
`python3 multivariate_cox_regression.py`\
**Purpose**: perform multivariate Cox regression.\
**Demo Note**: the reader should change the type of cluster to be examined based on the options given in the comments.\
**Output**: a model summary printed to output.

`python3 random_survival_forest.py`\
**Purpose**: build a random survival forest to evaluate importance and measure model accuracy.\
**Output**: an importance plot in results/ and a concordance index printed to output.\
**Estimated time**: 2 minutes.
